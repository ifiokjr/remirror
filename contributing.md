# Contributing

<br />

## Getting Started

Fork [this respository](https://github.com/ifiokjr/remirror), clone your fork and add this repository as the upstream remote.

```bash
git clone <<FORKED_REPO_URL>>
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ifiokjr/remirror

yarn ## Install all dependencies

git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME # Checkout a branch and start working on it
```

To work on examples or the documentation website run:

```bash
yarn dev:docs
```

Once the build completes (can take a minute the first time) navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or another port if that one is already being used).

The documentation is written using [docz](https://docz.site) and all files and dependencies are available in the `/docs/` subdirectory. To add a new dependency, you will need to add it to `/docs/package.json` and not the top level package.json file.

<br />

## Testing

Unit tests can be run with the following commands.

```bash
yarn test # Unit Test
yarn test:integration # Unit + Integration Tests
```

Create tests inside of a `__tests__/` subfolder.

**For naming conventions, use the following.**

- Unit tests: `*.spec.ts(x)*`
- Integration tests: `*.test.ts(x)*`
- E2E tests: `*.e2e.ts(x)*` (although non currently exist)

Integration testing uses puppeteer to run browser tests in chrome. See an example in `/docs/editors/__tests__/ui-twitter.test.ts`

Currently the testing strategy for remirror is being worked out. The test coverage is a measly 30% and a lot of work needs to be done to bring this to an acceptable level.

Despite this, I do recommend that you add integration testing using puppeteer to ensure that changes you made don't break the build.

<br />

## Gitflow

I recommend that while working on your code you commit early and often. You won't be judged. All worked submitted in a pull request (see following section) will be squashed into one commit before merging.

Remirror by default using [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for git hooks which run

- Before each commit (lint and test changed files)
- Before each push (lint, typecheck and test)
- After a merge (install)

This can be annoying when attempting proof of concept work. If you'd like to turn it off run the following command.

```bash
yarn stop:hooks
```

This copies the `support/.config.sample.json` to `.config.json`. After this change your git commits and git pushes won't be checked for errors.

If you would like to resume per-commit and per-push checking simply run

```bash
yarn start:hooks
```

## Pull Request (PR) Process

Once your work is complete you'll want to create a Pull Request to share all that goodness with the rest of us.

1. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) using the github interface. The template will automatically populate for you.
2. Add a description and reference the issue this pull request addresses where applicable. The description will be used as the body of the git commit message since all pull request are squashed down into one commit before merging.
3. Tick off all relevant check boxes by placing an x between the square brackets i.e. `[ ]` to `[x]`.
4. Please add a screenshot where the change is related to the user interface or design. It makes it so much easier to grasp the intentions of your work. You can use your favourite GIF screenshare tool for creating animated screenshots.
5. Once submitted the PR will be addressed at our earliest convenience.
