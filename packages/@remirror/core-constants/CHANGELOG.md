### Major Changes

- The whole API for remirror has completely changed. These pre-release versions are a breaking
  change across all packages. The best way to know what's changed is to read the documentaion on the
  new documentation site `https://remirror.io`.
- 28bd8bea: This is a breaking change to the structure of published npm packages.

  - Move build directory from `lib` to `dist`
  - Remove option for multiple entry points. It is no longer possible to import module from
    '@remirror/core/lib/custom'
  - Only use one entry file.
  - Remove declaration source mapping for declaration files
  - Remove the src directory from being published.

- 7b817ac2: Rename all types and interfaces postfixed with `Params` to use the postfix `Parameter`.
  If your code was importing any matching interface you will need to update the name.
