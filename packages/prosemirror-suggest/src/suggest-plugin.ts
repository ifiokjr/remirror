 * In the following example we're creating an emoji suggest plugin that
 * responds to the colon character with a query and presents a list of matching
 * emojis based on the query typed so far.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Suggester, suggest } from 'prosemirror-suggest';
 *
 * const maxResults = 10;
 * let selectedIndex = 0;
 * let emojiList: string[] = [];
 * let showSuggestions = false;
 *
 * const suggestEmojis: Suggester = {
 *   // By default decorations are used to highlight the currently matched
 *   // suggestion in the dom.
 *   // In this example we don't need decorations (in fact they cause problems when the
 *   // emoji string replaces the query text in the dom).
 *   noDecorations: true,
 *   char: ':', // The character to match against
 *   name: 'emoji-suggestion', // a unique name
 *   appendText: '', // Text to append to the created match
 *
 *   // Keybindings are similar to prosemirror keymaps with a few extra niceties.
 *   // The key identifier can also include modifiers (e.g.) `Cmd-Space: () => false`
 *   // Return true to prevent any further keyboard handlers from running.
 *   keyBindings: {
 *     ArrowUp: () => {
 *       selectedIndex = rotateSelectionBackwards(selectedIndex, emojiList.length);

 *   },
 *
 *   onExit: () => {
 *     showSuggestions = false;
 *     emojiList = [];
 *     selectedIndex = 0;
 *   },
 *
 *   // Create a  function that is passed into the change, exit and keybinding handlers.
 *   // This is useful when these handlers are called in a different part of the app.
 *   createCommand: ({ match, view }) => {
 *     return (emoji,skinVariation) => {

 * const suggesterPlugin = suggest(suggestEmojis);
 *
 *  // Include the plugin in the created editor state.
 * const state = EditorState.create({schema,
 *   plugins: [suggesterPlugin],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The priority of the suggesters is the order in which they are passed into
 * this function.
 *
 * - `const plugin = suggest(two, one, three)` - Here `two` will be checked
 *   first, then `one` and then `three`.
 *
 * Only one suggester can match at any given time. The order and specificity of
 * the regex parameters help determines which suggester will be active.

 * @param suggesters - a list of suggesters in the order they should be
 * evaluated.
