// While these tests seem simple there is a reason for them.
//
// While using abstract classes in TypeScript if the code is compiled with TS the compiled properties are not
// added to the class definition. This means I can declare an abstract property on a base class and letter extend that class
// defining the class with a getter for that property without any issue.
// For some reason when using babel and the `@babel/preset-typescript` this was not the case.
// Getters defined in parent classes were being ignored as the value was being set to void.
// The solution has been to remove this preset and replace it with the plugin `@babel/plugin-transform-typescript`
// placed as the first plugin in the list.
//
// If the abstract class code is run through the Babel TS plugin first then it is handled properly..
// These tests are here as a flag, in case someone does changes the babel compile pipeline in a way that breaks things.
