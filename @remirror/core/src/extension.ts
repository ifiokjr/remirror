 * Extensions are fundamental to the way that Remirror works and they handle the

 *
 * @remarks
 * They allows for grouping items that affect editor functionality.
 *
 * - How the editor displays certain content, i.e. **bold**, _italic_,
 *   **underline**.
 * - Which commands should be made available e.g. `actions.bold()` to make
 *   selected text bold.
 * - Check if a command is currently active or enabled e.g.
 *   `actions.bold.isActive()`.
 * - Register Prosemirror plugins, keymaps, input rules paste rules and custom
 *   nodeViews which affect the behaviour of the editor.
 *
 * There are three types of `Extension`.
 *
 * - `NodeExtension` - For creating Prosemirror nodes in the editor. See
 *   {@link NodeExtension}
 * - `MarkExtension` - For creating Prosemirror marks in the editor. See
 *   {@link MarkExtension}
 * - `Extension` - For behaviour which doesn't need to be displayed in the dom.
 *
 * The extension is an abstract class that should not be used directly but
 * rather extended to add the intended functionality.
 *
 * ```ts
 * interface AwesomeExtOptions extends BaseExtensionOptions {
 *   isAwesome: boolean;
 * }
 *
 * class AwesomeExt extends Extension<AwesomeExtOptions> {
