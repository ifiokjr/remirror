Optionally allow to style the currently selected text

This adds a new option for the builtin preset, `persistentSelectionClass`. If that is set to a valid CSS class name any selection in the editor will be decorated with this class.

This can be used to keep an indication for the current selection even when the focus changes away from the editor.
