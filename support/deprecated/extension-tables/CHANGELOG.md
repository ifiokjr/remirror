## 1.0.0-next.0

> 2020-07-05

### Major Changes

- The whole API for remirror has completely changed. These pre-release versions are a breaking
  change across all packages. The best way to know what's changed is to read the documentaion on the
  new documentation site `https://remirror.io`.
- 28bd8bea: This is a breaking change to the structure of published npm packages.

  - Move build directory from `lib` to `dist`
  - Remove option for multiple entry points. It is no longer possible to import module from
    '@remirror/core/lib/custom'
  - Only use one entry file.
  - Remove declaration source mapping for declaration files
  - Remove the src directory from being published.

- 7b817ac2: Rename all types and interfaces postfixed with `Params` to use the postfix `Parameter`.
  If your code was importing any matching interface you will need to update the name.
- 304db6ba: This package is now deprecated. It has been replaced with
  [`@remirror/preset-table`](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/tree/next/@remirror/preset-tables).

  You can still install older versions, but no new releases are planned.
