  - The name should be hyphen deliniated `remirror-extension-new-rules` to separate words.
- Should export a named extension which uses the pascal version of the npm package name.
  - `remirror-extension-custom` should export `CustomExtension`.
  - `remirror-extension-new-rules` should export `NewRulesExtension.`

  `remirror-extension-[FRAMEWORK]-[NAME].
  - `remirror-extension-react-toggle-button` and exports `ReactToggleButtonExtension`.
  - `remirror-extension-angular-split` and exports `AngularSplitExtension`.
- Extensions which take options should export their options interface. The name should replace
