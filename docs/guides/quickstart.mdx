# Quickstart Guide

_A really quick way to get started is to [spin up our Next.js
example](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/blob/canary/examples/with-next/readme.md#getting-started)._

Remirror is comprised of core libraries like `@remirror/core` and UI libraries
like `@remirror/editor-social`.

The easiest way to get started is by using a UI library and for the purposes of
this demonstration we're going to use the package `@remirror/editor-wysiwyg`

Firstly it needs to be installed.

```bash
yarn add @emotion/core @remirror/editor-wysiwyg
```

Then in your code use the following.

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import { WysiwygEditor } from '@remirror/editor-wysiwyg';

export const MyWorldClassEditor = () => {
  return <WysiwygEditor />;
};
```

So that's a taste of a simplified `Remirror` editor setup.
