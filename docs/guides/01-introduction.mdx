# Introduction

This documentation is still a work in progress. It is being updated in parallel with the `next`
branch still has many iterations before it can be called useable.

While reading through this guide, if you find any errors or would like to suggest some improvements
you have several options.

- Open an issue in our [github repo](https://github.com/issues).
- Create a pull request with your proposed improvement (most pages have an edit button).
- Move on, because deadlines are looming and life is too short.

Whatever you decide I'm happy that you've taken the time to get to know the `remirror` project
better. I hope it proves to be worthy recipient of your time and attention.

## Target audience

This guide is targeted at three audiences.

- Consumers of the library.
- Extension developers.
- Contributors.

Labels will be used to identify advanced areas for extension developers and contributors.

Regardless of where you stand, I have endeavoured to make it approachable and interesting for a
whole range of developers.

This guide assumes that you're familiar with JavaScript and have some understanding of `React`. If
you're brand new to programming or JavaScript I would encourage you to look into other resources
before attempting to read through this. Of course, I'm not here to stop you from doing what you
want. Joy is a wonderful commodity and if you find any comfort while reading this documentation,
then by all means, craft your own beautifully unique path.
