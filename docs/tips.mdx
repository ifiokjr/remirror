### Order of marks

Most of the time the order of marks is unimportant. Whether a `<strong />` tag wraps an `<em />` tag
or visa versa has little impact on the user experience. However in some cases, as with links (anchor
tags) it can lead to some odd behaviour when tags the link tag isn't prioritized.

The following is one statement where the user has created a link and afterward gone and made some of
the text bold. Unfortunately the bold is given priority and wraps the anchor tag causing the link to
be broken around the `<strong />` tag in the html. The behaviour is consistent but it does look
wrong.

```html
<p class="">
  <a href="https://google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">This </a>
  <strong><a href="https://google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">IS</a></strong>
  <a href="https://google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> a link</a>
</p>
```

To solve this we just need to ensure that the anchor tag appears in the the schema first and hence
receives priority over all other marks.

```tsx
<RemirrorExtension Constructor={BoldExtension} priority={3}/>
<RemirrorExtension Constructor={LinkExtension} priority={1} /> // Give link a higher priority
```

Now the wrapping makes a lot more sense because prosemirror prioritises the mark which appears
earlier in the schema.

```html
<p class="">
  <a href="https://google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">This<strong>IS</strong> a link</a>
</p>
```
