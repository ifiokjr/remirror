# Introduction

Thanks for taking the time to explore this project.

At the moment the focus is on releasing a stable API and while this is ongoing
documentation has slipped from being the priority.

Right now the best way to understand the library is to read through the
codebase and take a look at how existing editors have been structured. A
quick way to get started is to [spin up our Next.js
example](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/blob/canary/examples/with-next/readme.md#getting-started).
