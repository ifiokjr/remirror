title: Installation
---

Rather than installing multiple scoped packages, the `remirror` package is a gateway to using all
the goodness that remirror provides while minimising your bundle size.

Use the installation instruction outlined below, depending on the package manager used in your
project.

```bash
# yarn
yarn add remirror@next @remirror/pm@next

# pnpm
pnpm add remirror@next @remirror/pm@next

# npm
npm install remirror@next @remirror/pm@next
```

You will also notice that you are also installing `@remirror/pm`. This is a peer dependency to all
the scoped `@remirror` packages which interact with `prosemirror-*`. It provides some assurances
around the versions of prosemirror libraries being used and helps simplify the codebase.

## Browser support

If you are using remirror with a project like [`next.js`](https://nextjs.org/) or
[`gatsby`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) you will also need to add the following browserlist
configuration.

Remirror aims to be compatible with all browsers released since **2017**.

To use this configuration in your own project you can add the following to your `package.json` file.
Tools like `babel` and `postcss` are aware of this configuration.

```json
{
  "browserslist": ["since 2017"]
}
```

You can also use a `.browserlistrc` file.

```markup
since 2017
```

The main reason for this configuration is to support class syntax properly. Projects like `next.js`
automatically compile your code down to `es5` which causes problems when extending classes. If you
don't plan on creating your own extensions or presets, you can ignore this requirement.

## Usage

Once installed you will be able to add the following code which creates an editor with the bold
extension active. Clicking the button when text is selected will toggle between bold and not bold.

```tsx
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
import { BoldExtension } from 'remirror/extension/bold';
import { RemirrorProvider, useManager, useRemirror } from 'remirror/react';

const Editor = () => {
  const { getRootProps, active, commands } = useRemirror();

  const toggleBold = useCallback(() => {
    commands.toggleBold();
  }, [commands]);

  return (
    <div>
      <div {...getRootProps()} />
      <button onClick={toggleBold} style={{ fontWeight: active.bold() ? 'bold' : undefined }}>
        Bold
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

const EditorWrapper = () => {
  const boldExtension = new BoldExtension();
  const manager = useManager([boldExtension]);

  return (
    <RemirrorProvider manager={manager}>
      <Editor />
    </RemirrorProvider>
  );
};
```

While a lot of the above code may not make much sense at the moment, keep reading the guide to
understand more.
