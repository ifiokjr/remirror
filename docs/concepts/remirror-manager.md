title: RemirrorManager
---

The `RemirrorManager` brings together the required `Extension`'s and `Preset`'s to provide their
behaviour to your editor. This is where `commands` and `helpers` are stored.

:::note

In the previous version of `remirror` the `RemirrorManager` referred to a `React` component. That
was in the _before times_ of which we will no longer speak.
