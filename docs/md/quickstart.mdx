Remirror is comprised of core librarys like `@remirror/core` and UI libraries like `@remirror/ui-twitter`.

The easiest way to get started is by using a UI library and for the purposes of this demonstration we're going to use the package `@remirror/ui-wysiwyg`

Firstly it needs to be installed.

```bash
yarn add @remirror/ui-wysiwyg
```

Then in your code use the following.

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import { WysiwygUI } from '@remirror/ui-wysiwyg';

export const MyWorldClassEditor = () => {
  return <WysiwygUI />;
};
```

My friend in just a few lines of code you've built a world class editor.
