### Extension

Extensions manage similar concerns. It allows for grouping items that affect

- How the editor displays certain content, i.e. **bold**, _italic_, **underline**.
- Makes certain commands available e.g. `actions.bold.command()` to make selected text bold.
- Check if a command is currently active or enabled e.g. `actions.bold.isActive()`.
- Register Prosemirror plugins, keymaps, input rules paste rules and custom nodeViews which affect the behaviour of the editor.

There are three types of `Extension`.

- `NodeExtension` - For creating Prosemirror nodes in the editor
- `MarkExtension` - For creating Prosemirror marks in the editor
- `Extension` - For behaviour which doesn't need to be displayed in the dom.
