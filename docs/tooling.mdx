title: Tooling

This document is a brief breakdown of the tools used when contributing to remirror and why these
choices where made.

## Pnpm

I've recently started moving over several projects so use `pnpm` and I'm very happy with what I've
seen so far.

- Great workspace support (modules are scoped to the package where they are installed).
- Fast
- I like the colors in the CLI
- Regular updates. One of the things that scared me about `yarn` was the sudden break between
  version 1 and 2. They're basically two separate projects with the same name. Pnpm has a track
  record of incremental updates and speedy bug fixes.
- Reduce multiple copies of node_modules being downloaded and installed on my machine

One of the potential pitfalls of this choice is the lack of support for tools like react native.
Certain tools don't work well with symlinks and this could be a problem. A workaround for react
native is two switch to using `haul` as the bundler.
